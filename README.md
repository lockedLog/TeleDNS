# TeleDNS
Telegram bot that performs DNS searches on a domain.
I am not actively hosting this bot, it needs to be self hosted. Host can see the messages sent by a user while running.
Tool allows for overall DNS information lookup, whois lookup, and status of a website.
!output is used to change from tele message, text file, and json file outputs of the response.

Bots and their respective tokens can be made and grabbed with @botfather on telegram.
